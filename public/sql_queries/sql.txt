1 . Create the get all posts

SELECT title FROM posts;

2. Create the get post  by id

SELECT * FROM posts where post_id = 2;


3. Create the get posts ordered by rating

SELECT * FROM posts ORDER BY rating DESC;

4. Create the get posts by title partial filter (remember the % symbol)

SELECT * FROM posts WHERE title LIKE '%a%';

5. Create the get posts by topic partial filter query

SELECT * FROM posts JOIN topics ON posts.topic_id = topics.topic_id
WHERE topic_name LIKE '%s%';


6. Modify the get posts requests so that we can see the user data and the premium level on the same query result

                     JOIN premium ON users.premium_id = premium.premium_id;
